# Qishan Shi · Personal website

English website arranged in resume order: Education → Internship experience → Projects & awards → Personal profile.

## Editing

All displayed resume text is in **content.json**, in page order. Update the relevant entry and run:

```
python3 build.py
```

The `cv` field points to the downloadable PDF. Replace that file to update the CV. Set `linkedin` to the full `https://www.linkedin.com/in/...` profile URL to show its button; an empty value keeps it hidden. Optional `details` blocks hold expandable project methods.

This updates `index.html`. `build.py` controls page structure and `style.css` controls layout and colors. The site uses plain HTML and CSS with a small navigation script (`script.js`). All content remains readable without JavaScript. There are no external dependencies. The browser print stylesheet also provides a simpler layout for printing.
